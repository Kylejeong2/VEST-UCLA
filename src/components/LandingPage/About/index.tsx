      VEST at UCLA is a club that accelerates builders that want to start or join the next Unicorn company. We're hands on and love to do things rather than just plan things.

      <AboutParagraph>
        In our first quarter we hosted the founder of Zillow, a Thiel Fellow, and the founder of Manus, got a private tour of the new a16z office, got a Windsurf sponsorship, got dinner with the Head of Dorm at Pear VC, and worked with companies backed by YC and Neo.
