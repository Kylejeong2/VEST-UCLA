            One of UCLA's pioneering startup clubsâ€”a student-led community for
            builders, founders, and curious minds. We bring together driven
            individuals to explore entrepreneurship through hands-on projects
            and a tight-knit support network.

          VEST at UCLA is a club that accelerates builders that want to start or
          join the next Unicorn company. We're hands on and love to do things
          rather than just plan things.

          In our first quarter we hosted the founder of Zillow, a Thiel Fellow,
          and the founder of Manus, got a private tour of the new a16z office,
          got a Windsurf sponsorship, got dinner with the Head of Dorm at Pear
          VC, and worked with companies backed by YC and Neo.

          Some of our members raised over 2M+ in venture funding and scaled
          projects to tens of thousands of users. We also have engineers that
          were early at Cursor, Mercor, Etched, Browserbase, Interaction,
          Polymarket, Vercel, Mercury and more!
